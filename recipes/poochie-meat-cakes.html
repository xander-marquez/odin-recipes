            <li>1 ½ cups regular rolled oats</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). 
                Grease 36 cups of 3 large muffin tins.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, combine rice with water. 
                Bring to a boil over high heat, uncovered, and cook 10 minutes. 
                Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 20 minutes. 
                Remove from heat, let cool for 
                several minutes, then fluff with a fork and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine potatoes, carrots, celery, 
                ground beef, and eggs. Mix ingredients together 
                using your hands or a sturdy spoon. 
                Add salt, olive oil, rolled oats, and rice; mix well.</li>
            <li>Fill each muffin cup with some meat mixture, 
                and pat down to make it firm. Bake 45 minutes, 
                or until surface feels set. 
                Cool on a rack 10 minutes or longer.</li>
            <li>Remove meat cakes by turning the muffin tin upside down 
                over a sheet of aluminum foil. Tap each muffin cup to 
                release the cake. Refrigerate or freeze in sealed plastic bags. 
                NOTE: Do not feed dogs while still hot.</li>
